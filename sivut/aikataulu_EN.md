**This is a rough translation of the tasks for each week.**
Please refer to the Finnish version (or the front page) for the deadline date and times.

# Week 1:

* Deadline 1:
    * Subject for the project should be decided, as well as the scope and programming language.
        * In case you need help talk/e-mail your tutor.
    * Documentation: Specification document ready.
        * See the documentation instructions in English [here](/sivut/dokumentaatio_EN.md).
    * Weekly report number 1: Write the first weekly report (read [this](/sivut/palautukset_EN.md)).
    * Project: Project should be created as well as the version control should be initialized (Github). All weekly deadlines are based on what's on your GitHub repository at the time of the deadline expiration.
    * Allow issues in your GitHub settings, Finnish manual [here](/sivut/issuet.md) (there are pictures).
    * Register your project on: [https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/labtool/](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/labtool/)
        * Login to the Labtool using your University of Helsinki IT systems login
        * Your reviews for each deadline can be tracked in Labtool.

# Week 2:

* Deadline 2:
    * Written code should be clear and well commented (using [JavaDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc)).
        * See the documentation instructions in English [here](/sivut/dokumentaatio_EN.md).
    * Weekly report number 2: Write the second weekly report (read [this](/sivut/palautukset_EN.md)).
    * Program: Start programming the core consept/codebase of your program and remember to use good programming practices. In case you need, you can use default implementations of data structures in Java (for example ArrayList, Hashmap...), but however they need to be replaced later with your own implementations.
    * Testing: All code should be [_throughoutly_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) tested using unit tests (JUnit for Java).

# Week 3:

* Deadline 3:
    * Written code should be clear and well commented.
        * See the documentation instructions in English [here](/sivut/dokumentaatio_EN.md).
    * Weekly report number 3
    * Program: Progress with your program and possibly start implementing your own data structures (for example ArrayList).
    * Testing: All code should be [_throughoutly_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) tested using unit tests (JUnit for Java).

# Week 4:

* First peer-review partners are assigned. **Peer-review deadline is the same as week 5 deadline.**
* Check peer-review instructions in English [here](/sivut/vertaisarvioinnit_EN.md)
* Make sure your GitHub repository allows issues.

* Deadline 4:
    *  Written code should be clear and well commented.
        * See the documentation instructions in English [here](/sivut/dokumentaatio_EN.md).
    * Weekly report number 4
    * Program: Main functionality should be ready, own implementations of data structured started
    * Testing: All code should be [_throughoutly_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) tested using unit tests. Start performance testing (and other testing related to your project) and write these into your testing document.

# Week 5:

* Second set of peer-reviews are assigned at the end of this weeks deadline. **Peer-review deadline is the same as week 6 deadline.**

* Deadline 5: 
   * First peer-review should be done.
   *  Written code should be clear and well commented. Start writing implementation and testing document. 
        * See the documentation instructions in English [here](/sivut/dokumentaatio_EN.md).
   * Weekly report number 5
   * Program: Main functionality should be ready, own implementations of data structured started
   * Testing: All code should be [_throughoutly_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) tested using unit tests. Start performance testing (and other testing related to your project) and write these into your testing document.

# Week 6:

* Palautus 6:
   * Second peer-review should be done.
   *  Written code should be clear and well commented.
   * Weekly report number 6
   * Program: Main functionality should be ready, own implementation of data scructures mostly finished.
   * Testing: All code should be [_throughoutly_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) tested using unit tests. Performance testing should be done and well documented.

# Demo event:
