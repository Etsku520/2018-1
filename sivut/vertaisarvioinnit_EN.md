# Peer-review

Peer-review is part of the course and you get max 2 points per round. The peer-review's idea is to help you learn to read code that other people have written as well as their project.

## Instructions

You can view the peer-review case appointed to you via repository link in the labtool. Your task is to read and review your peer's work as well as to run the actual program (if able). 


 * Clone the project or download the project as a zip-file.
 * Write down the time you downloaded the project from the repository.
 * First read the **Spesification document**
 * Familiarize yourself with the program code and the tests. Try to understand what each class and method does.
 * Open the project in Netbeans and run the tests
 * Once you have thoroughly familiarized the poject it's time to give the actual review.

## Palautteenanto

In your review tell your peer what to improve. If you think you know how, feel free to give suggestions on how to do stuff or if there is something to improve in the project structure. If you find bugs or incorrect code, write about it. It would be useful to also mention if the tests don't work or if you are unable to build the project. Remember to write about positive stuff as well!

## Review is given via Github Issues:

* Go to the peer's repository with your browser and open the _Issues_ tab.
* Select _New Issue_ and give it the title "Peer-review".
* Write your review in the commentbox, you can preview your review in the _Preview_ tab
* There is a style guide above the comment box on how to do headers, bold, italics etc...
* Just to make sure, copy your review as a txt-file to your computer.
* Add the time and date you downloaded the project to beginning of the review.
* Save it by pressing _Submit new issue_ button.
* Remember that the review is publicly visible to everyone.
* **Put a direct link for your review to Labtool (so I know it's done)**

Peer-review rewards you with 0 to 2 points. Write at least 4 goo-quality well-formed comments for 2/2. The form is free, but try to write clearly and use chapters. Don't take the review you got too seriously. Remember that your project is still not finished and sometimes the reviewer might misunderstand details abour your work.

Katselmoinnista jaetaan 0-2 pistettä. Vähintään 4 laadukasta ja rakentavaa palautekommenttia riittää 2 pisteeseen. Palaute kirjoitetaan vapaamuotoisena, mutta yritä kirjoittaa selkeästi. Jaa palaute eri luokista eri kappaleisiin. Jos kirjoitat ranskalaisia viivoja, kirjoita kokonaisia lauseita tai mieluiten useita lauseita. Älä hyökkää palautteessa toista kohtaan! Toisaalta älä ota annettua palautetta itseesi - projektisihan on yhä kesken ja muokattavissa. Palautteen antajakin toisinaan ymmärtää väärin tai antaa virheellisiä ohjeita.

**Please note:** Project you are reviewing might be updated while you write up the review. That's why we include the time the repository is downloaded in the review.
