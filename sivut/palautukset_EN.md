## How to start?

All deadlines are returned for review via GitHub. Nothing is returned via e-mail. Make a repository in GitHub for your project then login into [Labtool](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/labtool/) and register your project.

## Weekly deadlines

A part of the course points comes from the weekly progression of your project. Make sure that your repository contains all weekly reports and is ready for review before the weekly deadline. Eventhough the deadline is only once a week, it is still recommended to push your progressionto the repository daily.

## Weekly report and work time tracking

Weekly report is around half A4 in size and is written for each week of the course. The report is returned for review at the same time with your deadline. **Keep track of the time you spend making your project. Be honest. The worktime doesn't affect your grade but is highly appreciated.**

Report should be done using either markdown or in pdf-file format.

The report should answer the following questions:

 * What did I do this week?
 * How has the project progressed?
 * What did I learn this week/day?
 * What was hard/unclear to you. Be honest, you might get help based on your writeup.
 * What will I do next?

You can include feedback or questions for the courses tutor, the questions are usually answered in the weekly review text. 

Voit sisällyttää viikkoraporttin myös palautetta tai kysymyksiä kurssin ohjaajalle, kysymyksiin pyritään vastaamaan viikkopalautteessa.
