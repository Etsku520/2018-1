# Documentation

All documents must be returned in either GitHub's supported [markup language](https://github.com/github/markup) or in pdf-format. Place your documents in the root folder of the project.
 
As well as the commented code you must do 4 different documents:

 
## Spesification document
* What algorithms and data-structures you use in your project.
* What problem are you solving in your project and why did you choose those algorithms and data-structures to solve the problem.
* What inputs does your program take and how are they used?
* What are your desired program running times ([big-o notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation))
* References
 
## Implementation document
* Main structure of your program
* Achieved run times and space requirements (O-analysis from pseudocode)
* Performance comparison and O-analysis if your project is comparison between algorithms
* Projects missing features and possible future improvements
* References

## Testing document
* What is tested and how
* What inputs did you use in your testing process
* How can the tests be repeated (for example JUnit)
* Program's performance as a result of empirical testing in graphical form
* Testing in ideal case should be a runnable program.
 
## Use Manual
* How do you run the program?
* What features are there and how to use them?
* What inputs does your program accept?
* Were is the jar- and do you need other files to run it?
